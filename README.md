Practice basic parts of Android Development

- A1 First App
  - Hello World! text
  - An About Me button.  When that button is clicked, the app displays a Toast to with your name and email.
  - A unique icon for the app that gets placed on the phoneâ€™s app list in the launcher
- A3 Clicky Clicky
  - When a button is clicked, the text should read "Pressed: A", where A is the letter of the button that is currently pressed, and the text should stay as long as the button is held down.  If no button is currently pressed, the text should read "Pressed: - ". 
- A4 Link Collector 
  - Add a "Link Collector" button to the main activity that brings up a new activity when tapped.
  - This new activity should have a list of links.
  - The user will tap a floating action button to start entering a new link, in which case the user enters a name and a URL for the link, which is added to the list.
  - Use a message in a snackbar (not a toast) to inform the user that the link was successfully created (or not).  
  - When the user taps a link in the list, launch the URL in a web browser.
- A5 Locator
  - That button will start a new activity to display location (latitude and longitude) from the location sensor.
  - Ask for permission only when the user uses this feature, not on installation.
- A6 At Your Service
  - Call an API and list the info received in good format
